					<h1>Bendy And The Ink Machine Fan Website</h1>
					<p> This was a small fan project that I created. It gathers inputs from the user to determine which character you are from the video game “Bendy and the Ink Machine.” It uses If, Else If and Else statements to sort the response. Then it appends an img element and p element to a hidden div class. It also has click functions on the buttons, one to run the statements and the other to reset a quiz counter. The art is not mine, only the code work is mine. </p>

				<div class="beetle"> 
					<h1>Beetle Site</h1>
					<p>This was my first java script project. The CSS was minimal but the JavaScript code was the main focus. I had listed img elements in an array and set a for each loop to help show the image. Then, I set the button to append an img element depending on the image address you put in the input box.</p>

					<h1>Puerto Rico Recipe Site</h1>
					<p> This is my Puerto Rican Recipes Website that salvaged from my 2019 project. In this, I photo edited a banner for the webpage. Alongside it comes the navigation bar, which hides and shows certain articles. I had the elements float to make a nice compact page that display different recipes. JavaScript was used to hide and show elements. All of the text used was not written by me. I only completed to design and coding of the website.</p>

					<h1>Motionless in White Fan Website</h1>
					<p> This is my Motionless in White Fan Website. Here, I set up elements in CSS in percentages. It's very small with a link to the dead stream event. No JavaScript was used, but the concept was interesting nonetheless. I updated the link for the video at the bottom to a clip from the actual event.</p>

					<h1> Last Breath of Death</h1>
					<p>This was a picture I drew based on the Undertale Fan Game called "Last Breath". This was posted on my Instagram along with a video speed edit on my YouTube channel.</p>

					<h1>Fan Made Dead Days Album Cover</h1>
					<p>Before Get Scared released the dead days album, I speculated on what the album would look like. I had photoshopped an album together in preparation for its release.</p>

					<h1>Dark Dream</h1>
					<p>During my 2nd year of high school, I photoshopped a picture of myself to express a darker tone of my creativity. It came out extremely creepy. But since it was Halloween, it was acceptable.</p>

					<h1>Toucan Dad</h1>
					<p>This was a joke image that a created in my 2nd year of high school. It was a reference to the election and cereal mascots.</p>
