        		<p>Hello everybody, my name is Ricardo Parson. I am current student at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School. I am a dedicated coder who is interested in perusing a career in the technology industry. I am also a digital artist who runs off of commissions. This portfolio will be updated heavily over the upcoming weeks with my projects.</p>

					<h3>Bendy And The Ink Machine Fan Website</h3>
					<p> This was a small fan project that I created. It gathers inputs from the user to determine which character you are from the video game “Bendy and the Ink Machine.” It uses If, Else If and Else statements to sort the response. Then it appends an img and p class to a hidden div class. It also has click functions on the buttons, one to run the statements and the other to reset a quiz counter. The art is not mine, only the code work is mine. </p>

					<h3>Beetle Site</h3>
					<p>This was my first java script project. The CSS was minimal but the javascript code was the main focus. I had listed img elements in a array and set a for each loop to help show the image. Then, I set the button to append an img depending on the address you put in the input box.</p>
