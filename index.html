        <p>Hello everybody, my name is Ricardo Parson. I am current student at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School. I am a dedicated coder who is interested in perusing a career in the technology industry. I am also a digital artist who runs off of commissions. This portfolio will be updated heavily over the upcoming weeks with my projects.</p>
